# Immunization Tracker Marketing Page

This is my first build week project and I had fun designing a marketing page from scratch.  With no UX designer in the group, I did some extra research on color theroy and leaned on the resources of Melissa Murphy, the front end architect for this project.

Here is the list of Third Party frameworks that were used in creating this website:

1.  [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
2.  [Magic CSS](https://www.minimamente.com/project/magic/)

I also used [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html) to create the images in the About page carousel.  

If you are going to download this repository and make modifications, you will also need to download the bootstrap and magic source code and put that in the directories specified by the `style.scss` file.
